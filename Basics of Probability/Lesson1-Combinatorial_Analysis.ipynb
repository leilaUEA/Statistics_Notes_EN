    "\n",
    "Statistics and probability are important in many areas including but not limited to computer science and engineering applications. Some example of daily applications are analysis of users behaviour of an specific mobile app, or customers of a bank and the use in other financial applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many real life scenarios we have some information, some predictions about the future and there is some probabilty about that predictions. Eventually, we want to make a decision that is the best based on information that is available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine there is a television game show that asks you to pay 5000 pounds as a registration fee, there are 1,000,000 participants from all over the country and if you win, the prize will be 50,000,000 pounds. The question is should you join this competition or not? What is the best decision? Using the statistics we can precisely compute the probablities and decide if you may lose money joining the competition or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your chance of winning or probability of winning is $ \\frac{1}{1000000} $ and the expected money that each person can get from the final prize is $ \\frac{1}{1000} \\times 50000 = 50 $ pounds. So, if you join the competition, your expected money loss will be 4950 pounds! It shows that by computing the expected value you can make a better  and informed decision about joining the competition.\n",

    "Why do we need to study combinatorics?\n",
    "Combinatorics is especially useful in computer science. Combinatorics methods can be used to develop estimates about how many operations a computer algorithm will require. Combinatorics is also important for the study of discrete probability [4]. Many of this lesson priciples are acting as the basis knowledge and fundamental way of thinking about many concepts in computer science."

    "# Combinatorics\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results. Combinatorics are used for computer science applications like cryptography, data analysis, probability calculation, and programming. They allow the mathematician to analyze information around patterns, possibilities, positions, order of operations, and restrictions. Combinatorics also have many uses in the real world and can be found in a wide variety of different subjects — including designing strategies, engineering, biomedicine, and transportation scheduling. However, the use for the different combinatorial methods varies depending on what the researcher/observer is trying to find [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorics is about study of counting sets of elements in a finite discrete structure. There are three principles to combinatorics — addition, multiplication, and inclusion/exclusion. However, there are two formulas used to calculate combinatorics; the permutation formula and the combination formula. In this lesson, we review these main principles. A set of examples are given in the form of multiple choice quizes to better understand each concept."
